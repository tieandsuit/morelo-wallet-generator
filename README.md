# Morelo-wallet-generator
Morelo offline wallet generator

This page generates a new Morelo address. It is self contained and does all the necessary calculations locally, so is suitable for generating a new wallet on a machine that is not connected to the network, and may even never be. This way, you can create a Morelo wallet without risking the keys.

For use, please download the git repository and use it locally
